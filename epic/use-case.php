					<dt>Use case</dt>
					<dd>Jen wants to post her thoughts on an article she just read on her favorite blog. She is away from home and she only can use a mobile app on her phone to do that. Even though an Apple app has less formatting features than a Windows application, Jen wants her post to look both professional and pretty. She also wants to be able to add custom emojis to her post.</dd>
