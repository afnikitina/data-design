				<p>Jen is a 35 year old woman, married with two children. Jen is a “stay at home mom.” She exercises regularly and tries to eat and feed her family as healthy as possible.</p>

				<p>Even though Jen is not tech-savvy, she is quite comfortable with modern technologies. Jen owns a new Dell Inspiron 17 5000 Series laptop (8th Gen Intel Core i7-8550U Processor 1.8GHz; 16GB DDR4 2400MHz RAM ; 17.3" Display; 1920 x 1080px; Windows 10 Home) and Apple iPhone 5S (iOS 7; 16GB Internal Storage; 1136-by-640-pixel resolution).</p>

			<div>
				<p>Jen likes to read articles at Cathe’s blog (https://cathe.com/category/blog/) and often leaves her comments there. Jen visits Cathe’s blog from both her iPhone and her laptop.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>Jen likes clear and simple site navigation and the simplicity of leaving comments there.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>What really frustrates Jen is when her comments got lost before she is able to post them. That happens to her quite often when she types her comments on her iPhone.</p>
